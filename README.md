# Working with real files

These are my scripts for 4.3 Section 3 - Working with real files of the 
Cisco NetAcad Python Essentials 2 course. 

char_freq_histogram.py prompts the user for the name of a text file and 
counts the number and frequency of alphabetical characters in it.

sorted_char_histogram.py uses a different method to count the number and 
frequency of characters, sorts them into descending order and writes them
to a new file.
